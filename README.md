# Tic Tac Toe Game
Tic Tac Toe Odin Project

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game allows players to play against each other or against an AI opponent. The project demonstrates the use of modern JavaScript features including async/await, modules, and factory functions.

## Features
- Player VS Player mode
- Player VS AI mode
- Choose your symbol: X or O
- Visual indication of the current player's turn
- Modal overlay for displaying the game result
- Reset button to start a new game

## How to Play
1. Choose the game mode (Player VS Player or Player VS AI) and your symbol (X or O) using the toggler buttons.
2. Click on the cells of the game board to place your symbol.
3. The first player to align their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
4. If no player aligns their symbols and the board is full, the game ends in a tie.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
